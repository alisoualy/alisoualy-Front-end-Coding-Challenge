for the front-end technology, i decided to use React js, first because i'm familiar with and it was the technology that i used in my last project, secondary React lets you build rich user-interfaces easily. Quality of user-interfaces is important because a poorly designed user-interface is generally less user-friendly and the users will not like a poorly designed UI.

for the style i used bootstrap because it is flexible and easy to work with. Its main advantages are that it is responsive by design, it maintains wide browser compatibility, it offers consistent design by using re-usable components, and it is very easy to use.

to get the data from api i used axios

to run the project you need to clone the project and install the node modules with npm install from the terminal and then you run npm start to see the project in your browser localy
